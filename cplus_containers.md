| memory model | - fixed size, no dynamical memory allocation<br />- elements memory allocated together with container itself | - automatically manage memory dynamically<br />- memory is contiguous | - automatically manage memory dynamically<br />- memory is contiguous<br />- all memroy might be reallocated if size is out of current memory allocation | - memory is not contiguous, and is managed as blocks of fixed-sized arrays<br />- memory blocks is allocated dynamically<br />- constant time at insertion and deletion at both beginning or ending<br />- like `std::vector`, can be accessed using `[]` operator | - FIFO based on `std::deque` | - dynamically allocate memory for every node<br />- every node has pointers to both previous and next node<br />- no memory reallocation in any insertion for other nodes | - nodes only have pointer to next node, no pointer to previous node | - memory is dynamically allocated for every ndoe<br />- the internal data structure is red-black tree<br /><br />- for `set`, the key is the element itself | - memory is dynamically allocated for every node<br />- the internal data stucture is hash table(bucket), every key of map and element of set is hashed into one bucket, inside the bucket, the element is stored without order<br />- bucket is nto ordered, element inside bucket is alos not ordered<br />- for `set`, the key is element itself |

- *CopyConstructible* must be *MoveConstructible*
- *MoveConstructible* might not be *CopyConstructible*
- *CopyConstructible* have more strict requirement than *MoveConstructible*
